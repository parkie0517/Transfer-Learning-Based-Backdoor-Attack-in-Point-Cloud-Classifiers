# Transfer-Learning-Based-Backdoor-Attack-in-Point-Cloud-Classifiers
A Study on Transfer Learning-Based Investigation of Backdoor Attack Vulnerabilities in 3D Point Cloud Classifiers

Directions for usage
1. put the point cloud text file into the same directory as the python files.
2. to visualize the point cloud file type in
   "python visualize_pc.py toilet_0001.txt"
3. to add a trigger then visualize the point cloud file type in
   "python visualize_sphere.py table_0001"
